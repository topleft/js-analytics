# JavaScript Page Analytics

Learn event handling, element offset, data manipulation, timers, and lots of JavaScript/jQuery!

## Requirements

1. Add a fixed button (use Bootstrap to make it look nice) that a user can click to view analytics about their browser viewing behavior.
1. On the button click, the data collection must pause while the end user is viewing the analytics. Use a modal or a light-box to display the data. Make it look nice! Add another event to re-trigger the collection of data after the user is done viewing the analytics.
1. You should display the following data:
  - Percentage of the page viewed
  - Total distance scrolled
  - Time before clicking the green "Sign Up" button
  - Time spent on page
  - Time spent on each section of the page

> You should be able to add the script to any web page!

## Stretch Goals

1. Display the results in a chart or graph
1. Add unit tests.
1. Add a heat-map that visually shows how long a user spent looking at different parts of the page.
